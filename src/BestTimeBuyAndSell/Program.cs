//QUESTION

//You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

//You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

//Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.



//Example 1:

//Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
//Output: 5
//Explanation: Buy on day 2(price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.
//Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
//Example 2:

//Input: prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
