# Algorithm Solutions In C#
In this repo you will find algorithm questions solved with C#. I also added different solutions to some questions. I will add new questions and solutions as I have time. I hope that will be useful

In this repo you will find C# solutions to LeetCode algorithm questions.  
I try to create alternative solutions as much as possible.  
I solve these questions in my spare time and believe me I am very busy.  
So it's a slow growing repo.  
But as I find the opportunity, I will continue to share solutions from easy to difficult.
